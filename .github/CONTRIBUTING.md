# How to contribute:

First off, thank you for considering contributing to BioCor, and using it or considering it.

I welcome:

# Pull request

Try to keep the format and style of coding, this includes using:
 * [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) to create documentation pages, 
 * [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for testing, and
 * following the [google R style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and the Bioconductor recomendations. 

I try to maintain a code coverage above 75%, so if you send a pull request, please provide the necessary tests.

# Licensing
